#  Abstract
Retinal vessel segmentation is a crucial step for various medical applications, as it is widely
used in monitoring disease progression and evaluating of various ophthalmologic diseases.
However, manual vessel segmentation by trained specialists is a repetitive and time-consuming
task. In the last two decades, many approaches have been introduced to segment the retinal
vessels automatically.
With the more recent advances in the field of neural networks and deep learning, multiple
methods have been implemented with a focus on the segmentation and delineation of the
blood vessels. Deep Learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have
recently become one of the new trends in the Computer Vision area. Their ability to find
strong spatially local correlations in the data at different abstraction levels allows them to
learn a set of filters that are useful to correctly segment the data when given a labeled training
set.
In this dissertation, two different approaches based on deep learning techniques for the
segmentation of retinal blood vessels are studied. The first approach is based on Patch-wise
Classification and the second one on Pixel-wise Segmentation. From the models implemented
we will chose the most effective from each approach and finally, construct a system that can
combine the two deep learning approaches in order to optimize the results, based on Ensemble
Learning.
